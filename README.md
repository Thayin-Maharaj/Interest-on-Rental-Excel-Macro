# Interest-on-Rental-Excel-Macro
This macro was created to be able to solve for the interest earned when renting out office equipment to other parties. The spreadsheet uses the total cost of equipment, number of periods for rental and the monthly rental figure that was agreed upon by both parties. The macro then iterates on the solution for interest using a basic numerical method.
